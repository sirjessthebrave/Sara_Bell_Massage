	<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
Hello! Welcome to my website! I am Sara and I was born and raised in California.  After living in a variety of places from as far north as Oregon and as far south as Santa Cruz, my heart brought me back to Humboldt County.  I originally started school at Humboldt State to study kinesiology when I became interested in massage and bodywork. I attended Arcata School of Massage and graduated in 2012. During that time I also trained to become a teacher in both Mat and Reformer Stott Pilates with Ineka at Mindful Movement Collective. I instantly fell in love with bodywork and the art of healing and wellness. I continue my education whenever possible by doing Pilates workshops and advanced massage technique classes. I now also teach Postural Analysis at Arcata School of Massage. The more I learn, the more I continue to combine a wide range of techniques to find the best way for each individual client to reach optimal health and body awareness. I find through anatomy, reflexology, pathology, physiology, energetic and lymphatic flow, Swedish massage techniques, myofascial release, trigger point therapy, shiatsu and thai yoga massage fundamentals and Pilates principles along with a dialogue with each individual client we can work together to create a unique treatment plan to reach optimal health and happiness.
